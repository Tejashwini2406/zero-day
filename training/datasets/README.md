Training datasets folder. Place real downloaded datasets here.

This folder should contain the real datasets used for training and evaluation. Expected layout:

- `training/datasets/kubernetes_anomaly/`
- `training/datasets/kubeiq/`
- `training/datasets/nslkdd/`
- `training/datasets/opentelemetry_ebpf/`
- `training/datasets/cloud_vulns/`
- `training/datasets/graph_anomaly/`

Temporary samples are located under `training/datasets/samples/` for local testing.
