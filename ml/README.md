# ML Baselines: Autoencoder, LSTM-AE, DeepLog

This folder contains baseline anomaly detection models for telemetry sequences:
- Autoencoder (tabular reconstruction)
- LSTM-AE (sequence reconstruction)
- DeepLog-like LSTM next-event predictor (for syscall sequences)

It includes synthetic data generators, training scripts, evaluation metrics, and a small notebook for experimentation.
